This is a proof-of-concept of using Gaussian elimination to solve for groups of
hashes that XOR to produce a given target hash. This technique is based on
Appendix A of [XOR MACs: New Methods for Message Authentication Using Finite
Pseudorandom Functions](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/inc-hash.pdf)
(Bellare et al, 2006).
