This is a proof-of-concept of using Gaussian elimination to solve for groups of
hashes that XOR to produce a given target hash. This technique is based on
Appendix A of [A New Paradigm for Collision-free Hashing: Incrementality at
Reduced Cost](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/inc-hash.pdf) (Bellare et
al, 1996).
